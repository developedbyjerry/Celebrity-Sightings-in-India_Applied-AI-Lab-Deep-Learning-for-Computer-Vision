# 👤 Face Detection and Recognition with Mary Kom 🥊  

## 🌟 Project Overview  
The project aims to teach you how to perform **face detection and recognition** tasks using a video of an interview with Indian Olympic boxer **Mary Kom**. 🎥 You'll leverage a state-of-the-art pre-trained **Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN)** model combined with the **Inception-ResNet** model to achieve accurate face recognition. 🧠  
The goal is to extract selected video frames of Mary Kom and her interviewer, create **face embeddings** for each of them, and use these embeddings to detect their faces in new images. 🖼️ Finally, you'll wrap your code into a **Flask app** that allows users to upload an image and perform face recognition. 🌐 

**Key Components**:

1. **Pre-trained Models**: 
   - **MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Network)**: Used for detecting face bounding boxes and cropping faces from images.
   - **Inception-ResNet**: Used to create face embeddings for face recognition tasks.

2. **Face Embeddings**:
   - Extract face embeddings for Mary Kom and her interviewer using selected video frames.
   - Create a library of known face embeddings to facilitate face recognition.

3. **Recognition Tasks**:
   - Detect faces in new images by comparing them with the library of known faces.
   - Determine if an image contains a face that matches the known face embeddings.

4. **Application Development**:
   - Build a Flask app to allow users to upload images and perform face recognition tasks through a user-friendly interface.

**Skills and Knowledge Gained**:

- 🤖 **How to use pre-trained MTCNN and Inception-ResNet V1 models from `facenet_pytorch`**  
- 📦 **How to obtain face bounding boxes and cropped faces using MTCNN**  
- 🧬 **How to create face embeddings using Inception-ResNet**  
- 📚 **How to construct a library of known face embeddings**  
- 🔍 **How to determine if an image contains a face from the library of known faces**  
- 🚀 **How to build and deploy a Flask app for face recognition**  

This project is a fantastic opportunity to explore **advanced computer vision techniques and to harness the power of state-of-the-art models** and build a practical seamless application for face recognition! 👩‍💻✨
